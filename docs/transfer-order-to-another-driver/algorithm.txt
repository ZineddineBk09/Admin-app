Asana task name: الادمن ممكن يحول طلب من علي سواق سائق آخر 

01- To accomplish this task first i thought about implementing a filter on orders list (dashboard page) so that the admin can have the ability to filter the assigned and in progress orders
    |
    |__ 01-1- the filters are: new, assigned, in progress, done, canceled
    |__ 01-2- filters will be modal with a list of filters that the admin can choose from

02- The after filtering the orders list, the admin can click on the order he wants to transfer to another driver and then click on the assign to another driver button
    |
    |__ 02-1- the assign to another driver button will be available only to orders with customer location, if not the admin have to add the customer location first
    |__ 02-2- the assign to another driver button will be disabled on the new, done and canceled orders
    
03- After clicking on the assign to another driver button, a modal will appear with a list of drivers that the admin can choose from to assign the order to
    |
    |__ 03-1- the list of drivers will be fetched from the API using a special endpoint that returns only close by drivers
    |__ 03-2- the list of drivers will be sorted by the closest to the customer location
    |__ 03-3- the admin should have the ability to assign the order to many drivers at the same time, and the 1st one who accepts the order will get it
   
04- After choosing the driver, the admin can click on the assign button to assign the order to the driver
        


QUESTIONS I HAVE:
  - will the admin propose the order to drivers (more logical), or will assign it directly to a driver?
  - will the admin have the ability to assign the order to many drivers at the same time, and the 1st one who accepts the order will get it?
  - will the admin have the ability to assign the order to a driver who is not close by the customer location?
